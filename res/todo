Todo:
	BEHAVIOURIAL ALLOCATION
		Check threads using 
			https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/benchmark-tests.html
			https://llogiq.github.io/2015/06/16/bench.html

		if neighbour is one pass, likely that is is one pass (therefore trivial)
		Thread creation according to complexity

	Pixel output

	Animated zoom?
		Reuse prev values somehow?

	Generic fractal finder with custom fnc input 
	
	Experiments:
		replace "-1.0*size"
			see impact on speed
		"Bad version"
			rounding to figures found before to save time
		sq compute?
