Trying out Rust for the first time

##Terminal Output with `-t`

##Greyscale Output with `-b`

##Colour Output
This uses a colouring function based off the cosine curve using:
![](/res/form.gif)
Where g represents a variable determined by the colour channel required and p is the number of passes required.
This gives an output like:
